# Build & Deploy SciKit Learn Machine Learning Model with AWS Sagemaker

Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed platform that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models at any scale. Amazon SageMaker removes all the barriers that typically slow down developers who want to use machine learning. In this tech talk, we will introduce you to the concepts of Amazon SageMaker including a one-click training environment, highly-optimized machine learning algorithms with built-in model tuning, and deployment of ML models. With zero setup required, Amazon SageMaker significantly decreases your training time and the overall cost of getting ML models from concept to production.
